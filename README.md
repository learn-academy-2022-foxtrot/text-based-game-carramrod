    Search the House
        Find Weapons
        Find Supplies

        Get Distracted
    Do Nothing
        You are killed by zombies
        A concussed sheriff on a horse appears

        You find the world abandonded 
        You are attacked by your neighbor(?)
        Look Around (poster on the wall for exfil instructions)

    After first choice
        Kick user back to hash 1 first options if still alive 
        If attacked by neighbor, either fight them off or run away (depending on weapon) running away will lead to new area
        Finding the world abandonded also leads to a new area

    New Area (Neighborhood)
        Go to the Woods, or City, around city
        Go towards the city
            Maybe make boat, try to not get eaten
                Car, Walk, Bike
        go around the city
            Miss boat, get eaten
                Kick User back to the start
        Woods (Death)
            You are attacked by a bear. You are dead.
            You drowned trying to cross the river. You are dead.

    City 
        Car
            Runs out of gas. Dead
            Makes noise, draws zombie mob. Really dead.
        Bike
            Faster than walking, has a squeaky chain
            Stop for WD-40. Dead.
            Don't Stop. Dead.
        Walk
            Reach city by sundown
            Find Safe Shelter for the night. (Miss Boat)
                (Set Alarm) Make the boat, safe.
            Walk through the night, use flashlight? (You were spotted by Sherrif on a horse, you were shot and killed)
            No flashlight (Make it to the boat)
                Boat(Get onboard?)
                    No: You are dead from your stubborness
                    Yes: You failed to check your surroundings, you were killed by the "Captain"
    
    

Alt ending ideas: 

    hardware store:
        slip and die on wd40
        find another survivor in store (Glenn)
            go with him to sanctuary? 
                no: back to boat path 
                yes: go with him
                    Find sanctuary and Negan. Do you play baseball?
                        yes: round 1. Negan charges. what do you do?  
                            hit him: you miss. he hits you . you die
                            dodge: you get out of the way. he hits you with backswing. you die
                            run away: you outrun him and make it back to the woods. You lose Glenn. Florida Man finds you. 
                        no: he hits you with bat. brains everywhere. you become one of the zombie mob.
